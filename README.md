## About

The purpose of this repository is to establish and evaluate the implementation of an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) metaheuristic, applied to the Maximally Diverse Grouping Problem (MDGP). Techniques covered include the operation of an ALNS, a reheated Simulated Annealing framework, and the use of the Path-Relinking strategy.


## Running algorithm

All algorithms are written using [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and are available in the `src` directory. The only external package used was [NumPy](https://numpy.org/).

The algorithm can be run through the file `src/main.py`, where there are comments explaining how to select the problems and choose the different parameters.

In the `data` directory you can find some problems that can be executed by the algorithms. The `output` folder will store the algorithm execution results.

In the `src/notebooks for plotting` folder are the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) files that can be used to plot the results.
